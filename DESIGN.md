## What

For this project we will be implementing a search engine. We'll figure out how 
to best store the neccessary information in MariaDB, collect data from a 
limited number of pages, and create a simple web interface for quering our database.  

We'll probably be using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) to collect data and insert
it in the DB, [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com) as our DBMS, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) 
to implement our webserver, and [Angular](https://angular.io/) + 
[Material Design](https://material.io/) for our web interface.
